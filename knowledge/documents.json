In the absence of a load balancer address, kURL will enable the EKCO add-on's internal load balancer. (If EKCO 0.11.0+ is not available, then kURL will default to using the first primary instead of a load balancer. This is not recommended for production installs.) This prompt can be bypassed during the install process by specifying enableInternalLoadBalancer: true in the kURL yaml spec for the EKCO add-on."
